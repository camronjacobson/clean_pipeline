# Configuration profile for AM radio band optimization

# Frequency band parameters (AM band)
band:
  min_mhz: 0.53      # 530 kHz
  max_mhz: 1.7       # 1700 kHz
  step_khz: 10       # 10 kHz channel spacing

# Directional geometry parameters
# AM typically has longer range due to ground wave propagation
geometry:
  r_main_km: 100     # Longer range for AM
  r_off_km: 30       # Off-lobe still significant
  az_tolerance_deg: 10.0  # Wider tolerance for AM arrays

# Adjacent channel protection
# AM requires more guard channels due to wider sidebands
interference:
  guard_offsets: [-2, -1, 1, 2]  # Protect Â±2 adjacent channels
  
# Solver parameters
solver:
  timeout_seconds: 120  # More time for complex AM networks
  num_workers: 4
  
# Optimization weights
weights:
  w_span: 100      # Spectrum is precious in AM band
  w_count: 20      # Prioritize channel efficiency
  w_surplus: 1
