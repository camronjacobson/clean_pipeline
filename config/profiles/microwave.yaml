# Microwave configuration profile for spectrum optimization
# For microwave point-to-point and point-to-multipoint systems

# Frequency band parameters
# IMPORTANT: Adjust min_mhz and max_mhz based on your dataset's frequency range
# Common microwave bands:
#   - 2.4 GHz band: 2400-2500 MHz (ISM band)
#   - 5.8 GHz band: 5725-5875 MHz (ISM band)  
#   - 6 GHz band: 5925-6425 MHz (licensed)
#   - 11 GHz band: 10700-11700 MHz
#   - 18 GHz band: 17700-19700 MHz
#   - 23 GHz band: 21200-23600 MHz
#
# Before running optimization:
# 1. Check your dataset's frequency column to determine the range
# 2. Set min_mhz slightly below your lowest frequency
# 3. Set max_mhz slightly above your highest frequency
# 4. Adjust step_khz based on your system's channel bandwidth

band:
  min_mhz: 12700.0   # 12.7 GHz - Based on apps_13.parquet dataset min frequency
  max_mhz: 13250.0   # 13.25 GHz - Based on apps_13.parquet dataset max frequency  
  step_khz: 25000    # 25 MHz channel spacing for 12-13 GHz band

# Directional geometry parameters
# Microwave systems use highly directional antennas
geometry:
  r_main_km: 20      # Main lobe interference radius (reduced from 30km for realistic interference)
  r_off_km: 4        # Off-lobe interference radius (reduced from 5km due to high directivity)
  az_tolerance_deg: 2.0  # Tighter angular tolerance for precise microwave beams

# Adjacent channel protection
# Microwave systems typically have better selectivity
interference:
  guard_offsets: [-1, 1]  # Protect Â±1 adjacent channels
  
# Solver parameters
solver:
  timeout_seconds: 120  # Longer timeout for complex microwave networks
  num_workers: 4
  
# Optimization weights
# Adjusted for microwave characteristics
weights:
  w_span: 50       # Lower weight - spectrum span less critical with wide bandwidth
  w_count: 20      # Higher weight - minimize channel count for efficiency
  w_surplus: 2     # Slightly higher - encourage frequency reuse in directional systems
