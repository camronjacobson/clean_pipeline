# Fast microwave configuration - reduced complexity for quicker solving
# Simplified version with fewer channels for faster optimization

band:
  min_mhz: 12700.0   # 12.7 GHz - Based on apps_13.parquet dataset min frequency
  max_mhz: 13250.0   # 13.25 GHz - Based on apps_13.parquet dataset max frequency  
  step_khz: 50000    # 50 MHz channel spacing (doubled from 25 MHz for fewer channels)

# Directional geometry parameters
geometry:
